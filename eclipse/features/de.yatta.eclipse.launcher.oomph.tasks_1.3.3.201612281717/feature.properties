\n\
INTRODUCTION\n\
\n\
(A)	The following website(s), software and services (collectively \u201CYatta Platform\u201D) are provided by Yatta Solutions GmbH, located at Universitätsplatz 12, 34127 Kassel, Germany (\u201CYatta\u201D) and are subject to the following Terms and Conditions of Service (the \u201CAgreement\u201D).\n\
\n\
(B)	This Agreement applies to you (\u201CYou\u201D or \u201CUser\u201D) as a User of the Yatta Platform and regardless of whether You use the Yatta Platform as a Vendor or Purchaser. If You use the Yatta Platform on behalf of a business entity, that entity is also bound to this Agreement.\n\
\n\
(C)	The Yatta Platform consists of the \u201CYatta Marketplace\u201D and \u201CYatta Profiles\u201D.\n\
\n\
The Yatta Marketplace is a web-based service offered by Yatta, which supplements the open source Eclipse Marketplace Client with additional sales functions to enable \u201CVendors\u201D and Yatta (both parties jointly referred to as \u201CSeller\u201D) to sell commercial software, open source software and value added services (collectively, \u201CSolutions\u201D) via the Yatta Marketplace directly to \u201CPurchasers\u201D. The Yatta Marketplace can be accessed and used either by accessing the relevant Yatta Marketplace website or via the \u201CYatta Marketplace Plugin\u201D within the Eclipse IDE. In order to use the Yatta Marketplace, You need to register and/or sign in with a valid user account (as described in Part A) section 3).\n\
\n\
The Yatta Profiles service consists of a web-based platform (the \u201CYatta Profiles Website\u201D or \u201CeHub\u201D) that provides collections of useful Eclipse plugins and pre-defined workspace and configuration settings for Eclipse created by yourself or other users for specific programming tasks or software projects (each a \u201CProfile\u201D) as well as a client application, consisting of the \u201CYatta Launcher\u201D and the \u201CProfiles Plugin\u201D, which enables You to create, launch, manage, edit, update and share Your own or any third-party Profiles. In order to operate, Yatta Profiles requires (i) that an up-to-date version of the Yatta Marketplace Plugin is installed on Your device, and (ii) a valid user account. A Profile does not comprise any required plugins, which need to be downloaded and/or purchased separately (e.g. via an Eclipse download site, an Eclipse update site, or the Yatta Marketplace).\n\
\n\
(D)	This Agreement consists of two parts:\n\
\n\
Part A) (General Terms) is relevant to You regardless of whether You use the Yatta Platform as a Vendor or a Purchaser.\n\
\n\
Part B) (Terms relating to You as Purchaser) contains Terms and Conditions which are applicable to You as a Purchaser of content via the Yatta Platform.\n\
\n\
PART A) GENERAL TERMS\n\
\n\
1.	YATTA\u2019S ROLE AS A PLATFORM PROVIDER\n\
\n\
1.1	Any Solutions on the Yatta Marketplace are offered either by (i) Vendors (\u201CVendor Solutions\u201D), or (ii) Yatta (\u201CYatta Solutions\u201D), as specified in the respective Solution description on the Yatta Marketplace. Profiles are offered by Yatta. Any other content may be offered by users.\n\
\n\
1.2	For Vendor Solutions, Yatta acts solely as the platform provider who facilitates transactions that are carried out on the Yatta Marketplace. Instead, Yatta is neither the purchaser nor the seller of Vendor Solutions, and therefore not a party to any contract regarding a purchase for any Vendor Solution. Such contract is solely between You and Your counterparty and applies separately from this Agreement. Yatta does not assume any responsibility arising out of or in connection with such contract nor does Yatta act as an agent on any party\u2019s behalf.\n\
\n\
1.3	Notwithstanding that Yatta is not a party to the contract between You and Your counter-party, You acknowledge that some aspects of the purchase of Solutions (e.g. provision and calculation of pricing information, listing, reviews and other guidance, license verification, provision of automatic updates) entail the ongoing involvement of Yatta. However, Yatta does not review any Solutions and related information and Yatta has no control over and does not guarantee the existence, quality, safety, maintenance or legality of any Solutions, the truth or accuracy of any Solutions, listings or feedback, the ability of Vendors to sell the Solutions, the ability of Purchasers to pay for Solutions, or that a Purchaser or Vendor will actually complete or reverse (e.g. in case of cancellation) a transaction.\n\
\n\
1.4	The purchase contract is completed once You receive an email from Yatta and/or the Vendor (as the case may be) confirming the purchase of a Solution, and performance of this contract begins as soon as the purchase is complete.\n\
\n\
2.	USE OF THE YATTA PLATFORM\n\
\n\
2.1	In order to use Yatta Platform You must be at least 13 years of age. If You are 13 or older but a minor (in many countries less than 18 years of age), You must have Your parent or legal guardian\u2019s permission to use the Yatta Platform and to accept the Terms. You must not access the Yatta Platform if You are a person who is either barred or otherwise legally prohibited from receiving or using any purchased or otherwise acquired contents under the laws of the country in which You reside or from which You access or use Yatta Marketplace.\n\
\n\
2.2	If You use the Yatta Platform on behalf of a business entity, You represent that You have the authority to legally bind that entity.\n\
\n\
2.3	If You want to offer Solutions on the Yatta Marketplace, You have to be a merchant by means of the German Commercial Code and need to be confirmed as an authorized Vendor by entering into an additional Vendor Agreement with Yatta.\n\
\n\
2.4	If you are a consumer (sec. 13 German Civil Code), the Yatta Platform is available to You only in the country where you reside. You agree not to use or attempt to use the Yatta Platform from outside this location. Yatta may use technologies to verify Your compliance.\n\
\n\
2.5	Your use of the Yatta Marketplace includes the ability to enter into contracts and/or make transactions electronically. You acknowledge that Your electronic submissions constitute Your agreement and intent to be bound by and to pay for such contracts and transactions. Your agreement and intent to be bound by electronic submissions applies to all records relating to all transactions You enter into on Yatta Marketplace, including notices of cancellation, policies, contracts and licenses.\n\
\n\
2.6	To use the Yatta Platform, You will need a device that meets the system and compatibility requirements for the Eclipse IDE and the Yatta software, which may change from time to time, a modern web-browser as well as working Internet access. Your ability to use the Yatta Platform to the full benefit may be affected by these factors.\n\
\n\
2.7	You may need to install updates, such as bug fixes, patches, enhanced functions, missing plug-ins and new versions (collectively, \u201CUpdates\u201D) to the Yatta Marketplace Plugin, Yatta Profiles Launcher, the Yatta Profiles Plugin, or other related Yatta Software that might be introduced from time to time to continue to use the Yatta Platform and to access and/or download Solutions or Profiles.\n\
\n\
2.8	In connection with using or accessing the Yatta Platform You will not:\n\
\n\

l)	harvest or otherwise collect information about other users, such as email addresses, without their consent; or\n\
\n\
